## About me

I'm **Chanwoo Park**. In fall 2022, I will join MIT EECS as a first-year Ph.D. Student. 

My research interests are:
* (Multi-agent) Reinforcement Learning Theory and its Application
* Graph Neural Networks and Equivariant Neural Networks 
* Optimization
* Theory of Statistics

When I was an undergraduate student, I worked with Prof. Taesung Park([BIBS](http://bibs.snu.ac.kr/)), Prof. Byeong U. Park ([NIL](https://sites.google.com/view/theostat/home?authuser=0)), and Ernest K. Ryu([Ryu](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~ernestryu/)) at Seoul National University. I mainly researched optimization theory (acceleration). 

I am supported by Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies (KFAS). Super thanks!  

I have certification in Korea actuary since 2018. 

I am familiar with several programming languages, including Python, R, C++, Matlab, and Java, and I usually utilize them for research.

I run [ML-Theory-Korea](https://mltheory-korea.github.io/) with my colleagues. Feel free to mail me.
