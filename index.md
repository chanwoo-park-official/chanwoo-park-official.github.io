## About me

I am a Ph.D. candidate at MIT EECS & LIDS, advised by [Asu Ozdaglar](https://asu.mit.edu/). I am closely working with [Kaiqing Zhang](https://kzhang66.github.io/). 
My research experience includes previous work with [Amazon AGI](https://www.amazon.science/) and [NAVER AI](https://clova.ai/en/research/research-areas.html) (industry), as well as with the [Ryu Optimization Group](https://ernestryu.com/) and the [Bioinformatics Group](http://bibs.snu.ac.kr/) (academia).

My current research interest is multi-agent learning:
* Single/Multi-agent Sequential Decision Making LLMs Training with provable guarantees.-- It should combine game theory, sequential decision-making theory, and understandings of the recent advances in VLM. 

Feel free to reach me! I actively discuss various topics with folks! I am open to collaboration (but not advising currently), so please don't hesitate to reach out if you're excited about these topics and would like to work together! 

**I love [games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory)!!!! Life itself is a [game](https://a16z.com/games/) :)**

I have held a certification as a Korean actuary since 2018.

I run [ML-Theory-Korea](https://mltheory-korea.github.io/) with my colleagues. Feel free to email me (cpark97 at mit.edu) to join ML-theory-Korea. We are actively researching several areas.

### Mentee
* Hwangyu Jeong (Seoul National University): March 2025 - . Working on MDM Theory
* [Valentio Iversion](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/valentio-iverson) (University of Waterloo): June 2024 - . Working on LLM Theory

### Former Mentee
* [Jaeyeon Kim](https://jaeyeonkim01.github.io/) (SNU, Currently Harvard CS): Oct 2022 - Oct 2023. Worked on Optimization Theory ([H-duality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06628)). Now, he is my great co-worker. 

## News
* **May 2025**: [Multi-agent RL for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18439) paper got accepted to ACL 2025 as a main paper.
* **Feb 2025**: Check out the [Multi-agent RL for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18439) paper. Iâ€™m really enthusiastic about its framework, which enables the training of multi-agent LLM systems.
* **Jan 2025**: [LLM-no-regret](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16843) and [Blackswan-Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18422) are accepted for **ICLR 2025**. [Blackswan-Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18422) is also accepted for an **oral** paper for **ICLR 2025 Financial AI Workshop**. 
* **October 2024**: Now, I am a Ph.D. Candidate yay! 
* **October 2024**: A paper on [Adaptive-Multi-Agent-for-MedAI](https://openreview.net/forum?id=EKdk4vxKO4) has been accepted for an oral presentation for **NeurIPS 2024**. 
* **September 2024**: I am honored to be selected as a Takeda Fellowship Recipient, which supports students conducting research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and health. 
* **March 2024**: A paper on [LLM-no-regret](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16843) has been accepted for an oral presentation for **ICLR 2024 AGI Workshop: How Far Are We From AGI**. See y'all in Vienna. 
* **February 2024**: A paper on [Personalized-RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09337) is acceppted at **CVPR 2024**. I contributed by providing efficient RLHF with groupwise comparison and its theoretical analysis. Also, a paper on [Inequality-to-optimal-method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11035) is accepted at JMLR. This work was done when I was an undergraduate intern at SNU. 
* **February 2024** I got a master's degree! 
* **November 2023:** I am honored to be selected as a top reviewer in NeurIPS 2023.
* **September 2023:** I am honored to be selected as [Siebel Scholars](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230919861208/en/Siebel-Scholars-Foundation-Announces-Class-of-2024) Recipient.
* **September 2023:** Papers on [Markov Network Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09470) and [H-duality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06628) are accepted at **NeurIPS 2023**. 
* **September 2022:** Paper on a [Loss function perspective of mixed sample data augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09913) accepted at **NeurIPS 2022**. This work was done when I was an intern at NAVER AI Lab. I got **NeurIPS travel awards**!
* **September 2022:** I started my PhD at MIT! I also received an Xianhong Wu Fellowship from MIT.
