## About me

I'm **Chanwoo Park** , a student at Seoul National University. I major in Mathematics and Statistics, minor in Computer Science. 

More specifically, my research topic was mainly in the area of optimization, deep learning theory, nonparameteric inference, and applying to biological data. I have accumulated my own research experience in Generalized Structural Component Analysis (GSCA), Polygenic Score Matching (PSM), Optimized Gradient Methods (OGM), and Performane Estimation Problem methodology (PEP). I'm interested in deep learning theory, high dimensional statistics, optimization, and nonparameteric statistics. I have a solid backgrounds on mathematics and statistics. 

I was a researcher in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Lab ([BIBS](http://bibs.snu.ac.kr/)) at SNU, directed by Prof. Taesung Park. Under the guidance of Taesung Park, I wrote one paper, "Pure additive contribution of genetic variants to a risk prediction model using propensity score matching: application to type 2 diabetes"

I was a researcher in Nonparameteric Inference Lab ([NIL](https://sites.google.com/view/theostat/home?authuser=0)) at SNU, directed by Prof. Byeong U. Park. Under the guidance of Byeong U. Park, I researched about the activation function which minimax rate is optimal up to logarithm, such as ReLU or spline. In addition, I studied the connection between Lie group and statistics.

Currently, I'm a researcher in Ryu's Optimization Group ([Ryu](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~ernestryu/)) at SNU, directed by Ernest K. Ryu. I'm really excited when I study optimization theory. 

I have certification in Korea acturary since 2018. 

I am familiar with several programming languages, including Python, R, C++, Matlab and Java, and I usually utilize them for research. As a hobby, I used to play the electronic guitar, and running through Gwanak Mountain.
