## About me


I am a first-year Ph.D. student at MIT EECS & LIDS, advised by [Asu Ozdaglar](https://asu.mit.edu/). I am closely working with [Kaiqing Zhang](https://kzhang66.github.io/).

My current research interest is multi-agent learning:
* Intersection of Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning Theory, Game Theory, and Statistics
* Deep Learning (Theory): Diffusion Model and its aplication to Reinforcement Learning
* Equivariant Neural Networks (RL, DL)


Fortunately, as an undergraduate student, I worked with Prof. [Taesung Park](http://bibs.snu.ac.kr/) and Prof. [Ernest K. Ryu](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~ernestryu/) at Seoul National University. Also, I did a research internship in [NAVER AI Lab](https://clova.ai/ko/research/research-area-detail.html?id=0), advised by [Sangdoo Yun](https://sangdooyun.github.io/) and [Sanghyuk Chun](https://sanghyukchun.github.io/home/). I researched Deep Learning Theory with Computer Vision. 

I am supported by [Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies](https://eng.kfas.or.kr/). Super thanks!  

I am holding the certification in Korean actuary since 2018.

I run [ML-Theory-Korea](https://mltheory-korea.github.io/) with my colleagues. I like to talk about the theory or application of deep learning (diffusion model, prompt learning...) and (multi-agent) reinforcement learning. Feel free to email me (cpark97 at mit.edu). We are actively researching on several areas.
