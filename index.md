## About me

I'm **Chanwoo Park**, a student at Seoul National University. I major in Mathematics and Statistics, minor in Computer Science. 

My research interests are:
* Deep learning theory
* High dimensional statistics
* Optimization
* Nonparametric statistics
* Statistical methods for applying biological data.

I have accumulated my own research experience in Generalized Structural Component Analysis (GSCA), Polygenic Score Matching (PSM), Optimized Gradient Methods (OGM), and Performance Estimation Problem methodology (PEP). 

I was a researcher in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Lab ([BIBS](http://bibs.snu.ac.kr/)) at SNU, directed by Prof. Taesung Park. Under the guidance of Taesung Park, I wrote one paper, "Pure additive contribution of genetic variants to a risk prediction model using propensity score matching: application to type 2 diabetes."

I was a researcher in Nonparametric Inference Lab ([NIL](https://sites.google.com/view/theostat/home?authuser=0)) at SNU, directed by Prof. Byeong U. Park. Under the guidance of Byeong U. Park, I researched the activation function which minimax rate is optimal up to logarithms, such as ReLU or spline. In addition, I studied the connection between the Lie group and statistics.

Currently, I'm a researcher in Ryu's Optimization Group ([Ryu](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~ernestryu/)) at SNU, directed by Ernest K. Ryu. I'm excited when I study optimization theory. The commonality of acceleration methods and the worst-case analysis were the main topic.

From Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies (KFAS), full tuition and stipend for doctorates in the US will be given. 

I have certification in Korea actuary since 2018. 

I am familiar with several programming languages, including Python, R, C++, Matlab, and Java, and I usually utilize them for research. As a hobby, I play the electric guitar and run through Gwanak Mountain.
