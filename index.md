## About me


I am a second-year Ph.D. student at MIT EECS & LIDS, advised by [Asu Ozdaglar](https://asu.mit.edu/). I am closely working with [Kaiqing Zhang](https://kzhang66.github.io/).

My current research interest is multi-agent learning:
* LLM Theory (including provable super-human AI, alignment problem, etc..), Intersection of Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning and Game Theory
* Deep Learning (Theory): Large Language Model Theory and Diffusion Model.
* Blockchain and DeFi system.

Feel free to reach me! I actively discuss various topics with folks! I am open to both collaborating/advising students (MIT / regardless of your location), so please don't hesitate to reach out if you're excited about these topics and would like to work together!

I worked with Prof. [Taesung Park](http://bibs.snu.ac.kr/) and [Ernest K. Ryu](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~ernestryu/) at Seoul National University. Also, I did a research internship in [NAVER AI Lab](https://clova.ai/ko/research/research-area-detail.html?id=0), advised by [Sangdoo Yun](https://sangdooyun.github.io/) and [Sanghyuk Chun](https://sanghyukchun.github.io/home/). I researched Deep Learning Theory with Computer Vision. 

I have held a certification in Korean actuary since 2018.

I run [ML-Theory-Korea](https://mltheory-korea.github.io/) with my colleagues. Feel free to email me (cpark97 at mit.edu) to join ML-theory-Korea. We are actively researching several areas.

### Mentee
